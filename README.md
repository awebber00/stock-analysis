## Results of Stock Performance Analysis:

### 2017 Stocks

For the stocks listed in the 2017 sheet almost all stocks had a positive appreciation by the end of the calender year. All appear to have a high volume of trades for that year (2017) as well. Green energy was a great sector for 2017 and investors would have seen as high as a 60% return on their investment.

### Overall Results & Summary

## Results

In conclusion, one year is simply not enough time to get a great analysis of which stocks would be favorable long term investments. The volume is also not a great sole indicator of which stocks will perform greatly from year to year as there was a significant decrease of return on investment from 2017 to 2018 for the stock that Steve's parents were interested in investing in (DQ).

## Summary: What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code? How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

#### Advantages
- Script is easily maintained and manageable for future updates
- Script speed is increased for optimal performance
- Script is easier to comprehend and more organized

#### Disadvantages
- Script may crash and have bugs that need to be debugged
- Could now be more expensive for clients if used as a solution to previous issues
- Cleaning code written by others may be time consuming

#### Pros & Cons

The pros and cons help in various areas as far as debugging and script errors are concerned and may help the analyst save time by delivering clear data about a stock's overall yeary performance. Although the refactored code is easier to comprehend, it may be a burden to anyone who hasn't written the code themselves and may be difficlut to troubleshoot if something goes wrong. One has to be knowledgeable with VBA to utilize the tool efficiently.
